      "LangGraph loops are a mechanism for creating stateful, cyclical workflows in LangGraph, allowing agents to iterate and refine their actions based on previous steps. This enables more complex and dynamic interactions than linear chains, as the graph can return to previous nodes based on conditions or agent decisions.

These loops are defined by conditional edges that determine the next node to visit based on the current state of the graph, effectively creating a feedback loop.

    "### 🔑 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Loop Edge**: `\"continue\": \"improve\"` creates the cycle\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   simple_loop.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "       \"improve\",\n",
    "       should_continue_simple,  # Routing function decides: loop or exit?\n",
    "       {\"continue\": \"improve\", \"end\": END}  # ← The magic happens here!\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Tracking**: `iteration` counter increments each pass\n",
    "   - Iteration 1: Brief answer\n",
    "   - Iteration 2: Add details\n",
    "   - Iteration 3: Expand further → **EXIT**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exit Condition**: `iteration >= max_iterations` breaks the loop\n",
    "   - **Critical**: Without this, infinite loop! 🔥\n",
    "   - Always have a safety limit!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 When to Use Fixed-Iteration Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good for**:\n",
    "- **Ensembling**: Generate 5 candidates, pick best\n",
    "- **Progressive elaboration**: Build up answer iteratively (as shown)\n",
    "- **Multi-round reasoning**: Chain of Thought across N steps\n",
    "- **Predictable workflows**: When you know exactly how many passes you need\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Not good for**:\n",

    "\n",
    "**What You Just Built:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "    A[generate] --> B[critique + score]\n",
    "    B --> C{score >= 80?}\n",
    "    C -->|Yes| D[END]\n",
    "    C -->|No| A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Innovation: Measurable Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of vague \"is it good enough?\", we have **objective scoring**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 5 criteria × 20 points each = 100\n",
    "1. Directly addresses query (20 pts)\n",
    "2. Specific examples/evidence (20 pts)  \n",
    "3. Well-structured logic (20 pts)\n",
    "4. Concrete details (20 pts)\n",
    "5. Complete coverage (20 pts)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is powerful:**\n",
    "- 📊 **Trackable**: Watch score improve each iteration (65 → 78 → 85)\n",
    "- 🎯 **Objective**: No ambiguity about \"good enough\"\n",
    "- 🔧 **Tunable**: Adjust threshold (70 for lenient, 90 for strict)\n",
    "- 🐛 **Debuggable**: See exactly which criteria failed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Exit Conditions: Two Ways Out\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if score >= 80:\n",
    "    return \"done\"  # ✅ Quality met!\n",
    "elif iteration >= 5:\n",
    "    return \"done\"  # ⚠️ Max reached, accept what we have\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return \"refine\"  # 🔄 Try again!\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Always have both**:\n",
    "1. ✅ **Quality check** (desired exit)\n",
    "2. ⚠️ **Max iterations** (safety exit to prevent infinite loops)\n",

    "- **Code generation**: Compile → Fix errors → Repeat until works\n",

    "❌ **Not ideal for**:\n",
    "- Tasks where quality is subjective\n",
    "- When you need deterministic iteration count\n",
    "- High-cost scenarios (could loop many times)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Experiments to Try\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjust threshold**: Change `score_threshold` to 70 (easier) or 90 (stricter)\n",
    "2. **Modify criteria**: Add your own scoring criteria\n",
    "3. **Different queries**: Try questions that naturally score high vs. low\n",

    "### 🎯 The Four Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PLAN Phase** (once)\n",
    "   - LLM breaks question into 2-3 search angles\n",
    "   - Stored in `search_plan` list\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SEARCH Loop** (repeats)\n",
    "   - Execute `search_plan[current_search_idx]`\n",
    "   - Accumulate results\n",
    "   - Increment `current_search_idx`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **EVALUATE** (after each search)\n",
    "   - Do we have enough information?\n",
    "   - Early exit if yes! (saves API calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SYNTHESIZE** (once at end)\n",
    "   - Combine all results\n",
    "   - Cite sources\n",
    "   - Produce final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 State Management Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ResearchLoopState:\n",
    "    search_plan: List[str]         # [\"query1\", \"query2\", \"query3\"]\n",
    "    current_search_idx: int        # Which search are we on? (0, 1, 2)\n",
    "    all_results: List[Dict]        # Accumulated results from all searches\n",
    "    is_sufficient: bool            # Early exit flag\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works**:\n",
    "- `search_plan` = **the roadmap**\n",
    "- `current_search_idx` = **where we are** on the roadmap\n",
    "- `all_results` = **what we've collected** so far\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Research agents**: Comprehensive information gathering  \n",
    "✅ **Competitive analysis**: Search multiple competitors  \n",
    "✅ **Due diligence**: Investigate different aspects  \n",
    "✅ **Multi-source fact-checking**: Verify from different angles  \n",
    "✅ **Market research**: Gather diverse perspectives  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 Why Early Exit Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without early exit: Always 3 searches = 3 API calls\n",
    "search 1 → search 2 → search 3 → synthesize\n",
    "\n",
    "# With early exit: Stop when sufficient\n",
    "search 1 → search 2 → sufficient! → synthesize  (saved 1 call!)\n",

    "\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "   if score >= 80:      # ✅ Goal achieved\n",
    "       return \"done\"\n",
